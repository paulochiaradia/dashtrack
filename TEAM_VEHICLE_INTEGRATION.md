# Team-Vehicle Integration Documentation

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

---

## üìã Overview

Complete integration between Teams and Vehicles, allowing companies to organize their fleet by teams. Successfully tested with **4/4 core endpoints** working (100% success rate).

---

## üöó Core Functionality

### Team-Vehicle Relationship
- **One-to-Many**: One team can have multiple vehicles
- **Optional Assignment**: Vehicles can exist without team assignment
- **Single Team**: Each vehicle belongs to at most one team
- **Company Scoped**: All assignments are within company boundaries

### Database Schema
```sql
-- vehicles table has team_id column
ALTER TABLE vehicles 
ADD COLUMN team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_vehicles_team ON vehicles(team_id);
```

---

## üîó Integration Endpoints

## üìä Implementation Details

### Handlers (internal/handlers/team.go)

#### GetTeamVehicles
```go
func (h *TeamHandler) GetTeamVehicles(c *gin.Context) {
    // 1. Validate company context
    // 2. Parse team ID from URL
    // 3. Verify team exists
    // 4. Call vehicleRepo.GetByTeam()
    // 5. Return vehicles with count
}
```

#### AssignVehicleToTeam
```go
func (h *TeamHandler) AssignVehicleToTeam(c *gin.Context) {
    // 1. Validate company context
    // 2. Parse team and vehicle IDs
    // 3. Verify both exist
    // 4. Call vehicleRepo.UpdateAssignment(teamID)
    // 5. Return success
}
```

#### UnassignVehicleFromTeam
```go
func (h *TeamHandler) UnassignVehicleFromTeam(c *gin.Context) {
    // 1. Validate company context
    // 2. Parse team and vehicle IDs
    // 3. Verify vehicle is assigned to team
    // 4. Call vehicleRepo.UpdateAssignment(nil)
    // 5. Return success
}
```

### Repository (internal/repository/vehicle.go)

#### GetByTeam
```go
func (r *VehicleRepository) GetByTeam(ctx, teamID, companyID) {
    query := `
        SELECT * FROM vehicles 
        WHERE team_id = $1 
          AND company_id = $2 
          AND deleted_at IS NULL
    `
}
```

#### UpdateAssignment
```go
func (r *VehicleRepository) UpdateAssignment(
    ctx, vehicleID, companyID, driverID, helperID, teamID
) {
    query := `
        UPDATE vehicles 
        SET team_id = $1, 
            driver_id = $2, 
            helper_id = $3,
            updated_at = NOW()
        WHERE id = $4 AND company_id = $5
    `
}
```

### Routes (internal/routes/team.go)
```go
// Company Admin routes
companyAdmin.GET("/:id/vehicles", r.teamHandler.GetTeamVehicles)
companyAdmin.POST("/:id/vehicles/:vehicleId", r.teamHandler.AssignVehicleToTeam)
companyAdmin.DELETE("/:id/vehicles/:vehicleId", r.teamHandler.UnassignVehicleFromTeam)
```

## üîÑ Integration Workflows

### Workflow 1: Organize Fleet by Teams
```mermaid
1. Create Team ‚Üí "Equipe de Entregas"
2. Create Vehicles ‚Üí ABC-1234, XYZ-9999
3. Assign Vehicles to Team
4. View Team Vehicles
5. Check Team Stats (vehicle_count)
```

### Workflow 2: Re-assign Vehicle
```mermaid
1. Vehicle assigned to Team A
2. Assign Vehicle to Team B (overwrites)
3. vehicle.team_id = Team B
4. Team A vehicle_count decreases
5. Team B vehicle_count increases
```

### Workflow 3: Driver Views Assigned Vehicle
```mermaid
1. Vehicle assigned to Team
2. Driver assigned to Vehicle
3. Driver calls GET /vehicles/my-vehicle
4. Returns vehicle with team information
```

## üöÄ Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Regional Teams
**Scenario:** Company has regional delivery teams  
**Implementation:**
- Team "Norte" ‚Üí Vehicles: ABC-1234, DEF-5678
- Team "Sul" ‚Üí Vehicles: GHI-9012, JKL-3456

### Use Case 2: Specialized Teams
**Scenario:** Different vehicle types for different teams  
**Implementation:**
- Team "Carga Pesada" ‚Üí Trucks only
- Team "Entregas R√°pidas" ‚Üí Motorcycles only

### Use Case 3: Temporary Assignments
**Scenario:** Vehicle needs maintenance, reassign  
**Implementation:**
1. Unassign vehicle from Team A
2. Assign replacement vehicle to Team A
3. After maintenance, reverse assignment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. ‚ùå **No Team History**: Can't see past team assignments
2. ‚ùå **No Audit Trail**: Assignment changes not logged
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Single Team Only**: Vehicle can't be shared between teams
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Capacity Limits**: Team can have unlimited vehicles

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Team assignment history tracking
- [ ] Audit logs for team-vehicle changes
- [ ] Team capacity management (max vehicles)
- [ ] Bulk vehicle assignment
- [ ] Vehicle pool (shared between teams)
- [ ] Assignment scheduling (future assignments)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Team not found"
**Cause:** Team doesn't exist or belongs to different company  
**Solution:** Verify team ID and company context

### Issue 2: "Vehicle not found"
**Cause:** Vehicle doesn't exist or belongs to different company  
**Solution:** Verify vehicle ID and company context

### Issue 3: "Vehicle is not assigned to this team"
**Cause:** Trying to unassign vehicle from wrong team  
**Solution:** Check current vehicle.team_id first

### Issue 4: Empty vehicle list
**Cause:** No vehicles assigned to team  
**Solution:** Assign vehicles using POST endpoint
